# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists — it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`.swamp-vault/ADRs/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (this repo — one Phoenix app, no separate bounded contexts yet):

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── .swamp-vault/ADRs/
│   ├── 0001-....md
│   └── 0002-....md
└── lib/
    ├── swamp/
    └── swamp_web/
```

Multi-context repo (presence of `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root) — not currently the case here, but if it becomes so:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── .swamp-vault/ADRs/                        ← system-wide decisions
└── lib/
    ├── ordering/
    │   └── CONTEXT.md
    └── billing/
        └── CONTEXT.md
```

Even in the multi-context case, ADRs stay in the single `.swamp-vault/ADRs` dir — no per-context ADR directories. Use frontmatter or filename prefixes to scope an ADR to a context if needed.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
