"""Pure ordering rules, free of DB and admin wiring.

Ported from ~/projects/gracie's ``portfolio/ordering.py``. The renumber rule is
the bug-prone part of drag-reordering (gaps left by deletes, the add-at-end
default, a moved span). Keeping it here — taking the already-ordered rows and
returning only the ones that changed — gives it its own test surface: the
interface *is* the test surface. Every sortable model in this app (``Work``,
``WorkImage``, and future ``content`` models) reuses this single helper.

    and is collected; rows already correct are skipped. The changed rows are
